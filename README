DEPENDENCIES
============
Yampa (previously we improved Yampa and used that instead; but for portability the code now supports the original Yampa. YampaMod is distributed as a separate package and can easily to be integrated back if desired)
OpenGL-2.2.2.0 (OpenGL-2.4.0.1 will break because they define their own GLfloat data type)
GLFW
HTTP

ISSUES
======

Currently this breaks with OpenGL-2.4.0.1 because they define GLfloat as a newtype instead of Float like before.
Thus you may need to
    cabal install OpenGL-2.2.2.0

If GLFW installation gets error, make sure you have libxrandr-dev installed.
Eg. For Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev libghc6-opengl-dev
