DEPENDENCIES
============
Yampa (our modified version)
OpenGL-2.2.2.0 (OpenGL-2.4.0.1 will break because they define their own GLfloat data type)
GLFW
HTTP

ISSUES
======

Currently this breaks with OpenGL-2.4.0.1 because they define GLfloat as a newtype instead of Float like before.
Thus you may need to
    cabal install OpenGL-2.2.2.0

If GLFW installation gets error, make sure you have libxrandr-dev installed.
Eg. For Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev libghc6-opengl-dev
