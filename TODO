This is the draft of ideas for what to be done on this current work:

1. Currently Hamball relies on a modified version of an experimental Yampa library. We modified it for our suite but it complicates the logic and we have to carry this experimental yampa code along.
This needs to be reworked.
2. The game is rather slow, especially when there are more people joining.  Need to do some profiling to find out where the bottleneck is.
3. No comments whatsoever: will add comment
4. Random ! here and there.  Find out when is the correct time to use them
5. Why is IL used instead of an Array
6. Restructure some data types
7. Do unit testing with QuickCheck
