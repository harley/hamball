This is the draft of ideas for what to be done on this current work:

1. Currently Hamball relies on a modified version of an experimental Yampa library. We needed to modify it to be threadsafe but now we have to carry this experimental yampa code along.
This may be reworked.
2. The game is rather slow, especially when there are more people joining.  Need to do some profiling to find out where the bottleneck is.
3. There's hardly any comment in the code: will add comment
4. Random ! here and there but not really consistent.  Find out when is the correct time to use them and whether it helps.
5. Why is IL used instead of an Array. (Check big O time)
6. Restructure some data types
7. Do unit testing with QuickCheck?
8. Change the way the game was run: It used to require running from the same game instance. Should make it downloadable, compilable
9. If server does not exist, maybe trigger server locally anyway?
10. Currently server segfaults if one player quits


1. client network thread should notify main thread when hWaitForInput fails, exit gracefully
2. why broke apart reactimate.  sense vs actuate should be sufficient
3. bottleneck: how often messages sent from client to server
4. initiatePlayer, but where is terminate Player
5. graceful exit to avoid seg fault.
6. test with seperation.  render vs network
7. fix to make it work with the new OPENGL
